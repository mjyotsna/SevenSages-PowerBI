In this project, you'll create a data model and Power BI report for Seven Sages Brewing Company that combines information from all over the company.
Your data model will make it possible for the company's CFO to quickly review and analyze what beers sell well and which ones generate the highest profitability.

At the end, you will have applied the key concepts of this course to combine and centralize data that was previously siloed, 
solving a very common issue facing many companies. More importantly, you'll have a solid foundation to build on when it comes to more complex reporting visualization demands,
advanced DAX requirements, or larger data models. No matter how large the data models get as your career progresses, the core principles remain the same.

Main Steps

Here are the main steps. 

    1)Source files. Downloaded the source files provided by SSBC.
    2)Sketch out the data model we intend to build.
    3)Loadd the data from the starter materials into Power BI.
    4)Structure, Clean and format our data so that it will work well in our data model.
    5)Create a date table to support time intelligence.
    6)Built a relationship from each dimension to the relevant key on the fact table.
    7)To satisfy the CFO's requirements, we will need to write six measuresâ€”to calculate Sales, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit Margin in two different currencies.
    8) Create a report. Build a basic visual report to display our findings
